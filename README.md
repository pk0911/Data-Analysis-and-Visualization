# DataAnalysis and Visualization in Python

## Data Analysis and Data Visualization

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data in a pictorial or graphical format. Data analytics is the process of analyzing data sets in order to make decision about the information they have.

## Objective

The goal is to analyse three different datasets: Election Donor Dataset, Stock market analysis dataset and Titanic dataset, analyse their data in orderto draw some conclusions from it and then display the outcome in graphical manner.

## Python Modules 

Some of the modules used in this project are:

1. Numpy module: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

2. Pandas module: Pandas is an open-source library that allows to you perform data manipulation and analysis in Python. Pandas Python library offers data manipulation and data operations for numerical tables and time series. It is built on top of NumPy, means it needs NumPy to operate.

3. Matplotlib module: Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy. 

4. Seaborn module: Seaborn is an open-source Python library built on top of matplotlib. It is used for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Seaborn works easily with dataframes and the Pandas library.
